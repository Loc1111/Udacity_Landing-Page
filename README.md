The project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM and to show you how javascript can improve the usabilty of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

You will be building a multi-section landing page. Often times, we don’t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu. Additionally, dynamically building the navigation is a great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM which you will experience when you begin working with JavaScript frameworks.

To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way. Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump.

The landing page presents the first opportunity to fully combine your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. Aside from solidifying your skills with these three technologies, you’ll discover how best to combine them in a complex application.
